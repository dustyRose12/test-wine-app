They harvest early to keep the acidity, and to give it more volume they keep the wine with the lees for five months. The wine was not bottled until March 2015. The nose is fresh and subtle with austere aromas (nothing tropical here), with notes of freshly cut grass, orange peel and something citric. The palate is fresh and with good acidity; it is still young and unevolved. I had the chance to taste 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010 next to it to check consistency and aging potential, and the wines develop nicely at least five years after the vintage, turning deeper, mellow and with musky aromas of grapefruit, hay, straw, quince, a touch of yeast, camphor and smoke that reminded me of aged Cava.

The result is a wine extremely important, full bodied, powerful but with extraordinary elegance, destined to develop characteristics produced by prolonged ageing. The Brunello that we produce at San Polo is produced only from our own vines from which we select a lesser quantity of grapes per hectare than that provided in the Disciplines, which is 80 quintals per hectare. We are particularly attentive to vinification procedures in the cellar which requires a long maceration at controlled temperature with frequent repassings. The wine is aged for 24 months in french barrique and we allow a period of refining in the bottle of at least 15 months before the wine is ready to drink.", created_at: "2017-11-10 22:29:44", updated_at: "2017-11-10 22:29:44", expert_review: "", existing_avg_user_rating: "0.0", existing_avg_user_rating_count: 0, upc: "", store_one: nil, link_one: nil, store_two: nil, link_two: nil, store_three: nil, link_three: nil},

Full-bodied, with chewy tannins and a raisiny, spicy aftertaste.'-Wine Spectator. The 1980 Brunello di Montalcino was the first wine in Italy to obtain the D.O.C.G. appellation (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita - controlled and guaranteed from the origin). The D.O.C.G. is the most prestigious classification of wine in Italy. As a result, only specialized and authorized vineyards can produce Brunello di Montalcino and a series of rules regarding production must be observed. Four years of total aging are required for Brunello. For more than a century Brunello was aged three of these four years in wood, but as from the 1995 vintage this requirement was reduced to two years. Nevertheless, at Poggio Antico we continue to respect the traditional method for our classic Brunello, keeping it three years in large oak barrels. Brunello must be produced with 100% Sangiovese grapes and a minimum of 12.5% alcohol by volume is required. Total acidity cannot be lower than five parts per thousand. At Poggio Antico the alcohol content, total acidity, and dry extract always reach optimum levels, thanks to low yields and the favorable geographical position of its vineyards. Poggio Antico's Brunello di Montalcino is typically deep and intense ruby red in color. The bouquet is well developed and persistent, and increases in intensity with further bottle aging. It has a very clean nose, with hints of blackberry and licorice. In the mouth it is rounded and concentrated, with great vitality, yet elegant and harmonious, thanks to the particularly sweet tannins.

The 'Lur' originate from Franconie (Fruin de Lur lived in Limousin in 990, while the 'Saluces' branch comes from the Marquisate of Saluzzo in the Piedmont). Under Louis XVI, in 1785 exactly, the domain of Yquem came into the Lur-Saluces family by the marriage of Françoise Joséphine de Sauvage, the 'Lady of Yquem', with Louis Amédée de Lur Saluces, colonel of Penthièvre dragons (who was a godson of Louis XV and Lady Victoire de France).", created_at: "2017-11-10 22:29:45", updated_at: "2017-11-10 22:29:45", expert_review: "Forward and flattering, with unctuous marmalade, blood orange, apricot chutney and ginger notes.

The result is a wine extremely important, full bodied, powerful but with extraordinary elegance, destined to develop characteristics produced by prolonged ageing. The Brunello that we produce at San Polo is produced only from our own vines from which we select a lesser quantity of grapes per hectare than that provided in the Disciplines, which is 80 quintals per hectare. We are particularly attentive to vinification procedures in the cellar which requires a long maceration at controlled temperature with frequent repassings.

Full-bodied, with chewy tannins and a raisiny, spicy aftertaste.'-Wine Spectator. The 1980 Brunello di Montalcino was the first wine in Italy to obtain the D.O.C.G. appellation (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita - controlled and guaranteed from the origin). The D.O.C.G. is the most prestigious classification of wine in Italy. As a result, only specialized and authorized vineyards can produce Brunello di Montalcino and a series of rules regarding production must be observed. Four years of total aging are required for Brunello. For more than a century Brunello was aged three of these four years in wood, but as from the 1995 vintage this requirement was reduced to two years. Nevertheless, at Poggio Antico we continue to respect the traditional method for our classic Brunello, keeping it three years in large oak barrels. Brunello must be produced with 100% Sangiovese grapes and a minimum of 12.5% alcohol by volume is required. Total acidity cannot be lower than five parts per thousand. At Poggio Antico the alcohol content, total acidity, and dry extract always reach optimum levels, thanks to low yields and the favorable geographical position of its vineyards. Poggio Antico's Brunello di Montalcino is typically deep and intense ruby red in color. The bouquet is well developed and persistent, and increases in intensity with further bottle aging. It has a very clean nose, with hints of blackberry and licorice. In the mouth it is rounded and concentrated, with great vitality, yet elegant and harmonious, thanks to the particularly sweet tannins. It has a very long finish and ages gracefully under proper conditions.", created_at: "2017-11-10 22:33:27", updated_at: "2017-11-10 22:33:27", expert_review: "", existing_avg_user_rating: "0.0", existing_avg_user_rating_count: 0, upc: "", store_one: nil, link_one: nil, store_two: nil, link_two: nil, store_three: nil, link_three: nil},

It is more structured and tannic than the 1989, more civilized and refined, but not as thick as the 1982, and sweeter as well as purer than the 1975. The 2000 is neither flamboyant nor accessible, but what upside potential it possesses! In time, one might have to return to the prodigious duo of 1959 and 1961 to find a La Mission with this much potential. While still tight from bottling, its inky purple color is accompanied by extravagantly sweet aromas of blackberries, blueberries, toast, scorched earth, coffee, asphalt, graphite, and smoke. Super-intense and unctuously-textured, with a sumptuous mid-palate and finish, this is an explosively rich, layered effort that possesses everything I could ever want from a terroir that has given me as much hedonistic and intellectual pleasure as any other wine in the world.

It's high in both acid and tannin, making it one of the more versatile grapes available to winemakers in the area. While oaking is not a prerequisite for every style, Sangiovese does end up in barrels the majority of the time. Oak aging tends to be light, although wines such as Brunello di Montalcino can see quite a bit of extra time on oak, which lends to the ability to age these wines for up to 18 years in the bottle. Anyone that loves a glass of Syrah will find a great deal to love about Sangiovese thanks to its smoky, rustic qualities that juxtapose nicely with fruit-forward acidity."}
