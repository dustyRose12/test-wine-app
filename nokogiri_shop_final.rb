Full-bodied, with chewy tannins and a raisiny, spicy aftertaste.'-Wine Spectator. The 1980 Brunello di Montalcino was the first wine in Italy to obtain the D.O.C.G. appellation (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita - controlled and guaranteed from the origin). The D.O.C.G. is the most prestigious classification of wine in Italy. As a result, only specialized and authorized vineyards can produce Brunello di Montalcino and a series of rules regarding production must be observed. Four years of total aging are required for Brunello. For more than a century Brunello was aged three of these four years in wood, but as from the 1995 vintage this requirement was reduced to two years. Nevertheless, at Poggio Antico we continue to respect the traditional method for our classic Brunello, keeping it three years in large oak barrels. Brunello must be produced with 100% Sangiovese grapes and a minimum of 12.5% alcohol by volume is required. Total acidity cannot be lower than five parts per thousand. At Poggio Antico the alcohol content, total acidity, and dry extract always reach optimum levels, thanks to low yields and the favorable geographical position of its vineyards. Poggio Antico's Brunello di Montalcino is typically deep and intense ruby red in color. The bouquet is well developed and persistent, and increases in intensity with further bottle aging. It has a very clean nose, with hints of blackberry and licorice. In the mouth it is rounded and concentrated, with great vitality, yet elegant and harmonious, thanks to the particularly sweet tannins. It has a very long finish and ages gracefully under proper conditions.", :image_url=>"www.wine.com/static/images/nolabel.gif", :expert_rating=>92.0, :professional_reviews=>"", :user_rating=>0.0, :upc => "", :user_rating_count=>0},
